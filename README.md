## Important Usage Notes

- Please verify all citations before turning in any work.  
  The stylesheet automates MLA9 formatting, but no automated system is perfect.

- Files created with this stylesheet will keep their formatting on any device. However, if another user refreshes the Source Manager without the stylesheet installed, Word will generate citations using a different template instead.

- For reports requiring a “Report no.” value, use the `Comments` field.
